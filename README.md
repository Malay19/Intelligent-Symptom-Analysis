# Intelligent Symptoms Analysis for Communicable Diseases

> **Empowering Early Detection Through AI and Explainable Machine Learning**

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

Intelligent Symptoms Analysis for Communicable Diseases is a comprehensive AI system designed to assist in the **early detection** of major communicable diseases purely based on **user-reported symptoms**. The project delivers:

1. **End-to-End Pipeline**  
   - **Data Cleaning & Fusion**: Ingests a raw CSV of 4,900+ records with 130+ symptoms, enriches with demographic (age, gender, region) and temporal (season) metadata, and outputs a unified dataset.  
   - **Feature Engineering**: Cleans text, lemmatizes, vectorizes via TF-IDF (n-grams), integrates symptom severity, and encodes auxiliary features.  
   - **Model Training**: Benchmarks classical (Random Forest, XGBoost) and deep architectures (Bidirectional LSTM, Transformer/BERT).  
   - **Explainability**: Implements **SHAP** for global feature importance and **LIME** for local decision explanations.  
   - **Deployment**: Exposes a Flask REST API and an interactive Streamlit UI for real-time symptom input, prediction, and visualization.

2. **High Accuracy & Trust**  
   - Achieves **94.6% accuracy** with the Transformer model, **F1-score 94.1%**, and **ROC-AUC 97.8%**.  
   - Interpretable outputs increase user and clinician confidence.

3. **Modularity & Extensibility**  
   - Clear separation of data, model, XAI, and UI layers allows easy addition of new diseases, languages, or data sources.

## ðŸ§  Motivation & Thought Process

- **Clinical Challenge**: Communicable diseases (e.g., COVID-19, Malaria, Dengue, TB) share overlapping early symptomsâ€”fever, cough, fatigueâ€”making manual triage error-prone.  
- **Resource Constraints**: Rural and low-resource settings face diagnostic delays due to lab/testing bottlenecks and clinician shortages.  
- **Technology Gap**: Existing symptom checkers rely on static, rule-based logic and provide no transparency, eroding trust among healthcare professionals.  
- **Research Vision**: Combine **deep learning** (to model complex symptom patterns) with **explainable AI** (to reveal decision logic), creating a **scalable**, **accessible**, and **transparent** tool that complements clinical workflows.
